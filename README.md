the client "The Gaming Room" is a game company who is looking for development to expand their game, Draw it or Lose it, from a game available explusivly to Android, to a game that serves multiple platforms. Including desktops, and IOS devices. One thing that i think i did particularly will in developing this documentation was explaining the differences between Linux, Mac, Windows and mobile operating systems. If i had to choose one aspect of the document to revise, it would be the server side development requirements. I think that there is much to cover considering the development aspects and security implementation that is needed to have a robust operating system. The way i interpreted the needs of the user when implementing it into the software design is thinking about my own experience as a user. Doing this helped because I was able to forcast what user might want to see by analyzing my own likes and dislikes about operating systems, latancy and user experience.
